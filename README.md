Coffee Project Front-end

https://bullhead242.github.io/coffee-project-frontend/

This app began its life as something I've always wanted: an app to quickly find
a coffee shop very quickly, based on a few simple requirements. I wanted the
user to make a few very simple choices such as location, what they wanted to do
at the shop (eat lunch, meet friends, get some work done, or just have coffee),
and it would spit out one simple answer, along with the results.

Does this sound do-able? Sure. In six days while I'm still trying to learn how to
put everything together? Probably not. So changes were made.

The first version you see is a shop and visit tracker. When the user logs in,
there is a list of shops, with buttons to choose which shops they've already visited.
Once they've visted, they can go to a separate visits page, where they can like or
dislike each shop, and hopefully add comments.

This version isn't quite there, but it's not far off, either.
